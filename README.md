### Note on the "Thirsty tiger" project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that wonâ€™t change.

```R
> library(codename)
> codename_message()
code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt).
> codename(type = "ubuntu", seed = 20240222)
[1] "thirsty tiger"
```
