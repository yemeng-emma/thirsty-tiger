$$
\text{Staffing level} = \frac{\text{Total number of direct care employees}}{\text{Number of beds/places in use}} \times 100
$$


$$
\text{Turnover rate} = \frac{\text{Number of employees who left in previous 12 months}}{\text{Average total number of employees in previous 12 months}} \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Average total number of employees in previous 12 months} = (\text{employes at beggining + employees at the end})/2
=(\text{employes at end + total leavers - total starters + employees at the end})/2
$$
